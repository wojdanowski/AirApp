Air quality app made as student team project. My task was to create frontend logic of the app. Air app takes air quality data from official government api and displays visualization on map.

User can pick location by typing street address, manually on map or by pressing geolocation icon. Choosing last option, App will locate user using geolocation Web API. User can also decide to get notification about given station and time when email should be sent.

Mapbox was implemented for map and reverse geocoding.

Made in team, other contributors on github repo.

Functionalities:
<ul>
  <li>Find your current location</li>
  <li>Find location base on address</li>
  <li>View air quality at stations</li>
  <li>Subscribe to get air quality notification to email</li>
</ul>
